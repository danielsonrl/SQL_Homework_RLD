## PyWeather_RLD
This exercise will involve me using what I have learned through my previous project entries in order to graph data visualizations of the weather.  Using Json files and APIs, I will be looking to show how the weather changes as it reaches the equator.  This activity has been provided by the Georgia Tech Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp.


#### -- Project Status: Completed
## Project Intro/Objective
The dataset contains records of various cities and their weather patterns.  Using the OpenWeatherMap API, I am able to obtain this data.  

### Partner
* Georgia Tech Data Science and Analytics

* OpenWeatherMap API
* https://openweathermap.org/api

### Methods Used
* Pandas 
* Matplotlib
* APIs
* Json Files

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
A series of scatter plots will be written that represent the following.

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

At least 500 unique cities based on latitude and longitude will be used.  A weather check based on a series of successive API calls will be initiated.  All CSV files and PNG images will be saved in the repository.

## Needs of this project
- Data Visualization 
- Descriptive Statistics
- Weather Forecasting
